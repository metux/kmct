kernel meta config tool
-----------------------

This tool automatically creates kernel .config's from a high level
meta-configuration.

When dealing with lots of embedded applications on lots of different
boards, creating an optimal kernel config can be time-consuming task.

Let's say you just wann enable the ethernet port, you'll have to find
out which NIC, PHY, etc, are needed. Further imagine, you're porting
to another board, you'll have to do the same again and also find out
which settings you can disable again.

KMCT allows specifying your configuration on a much higher level:
Just activate the corresponding board and the required features,
and kmct will generate the .config for you.


NOTE: it's still in a very early stage. only one board config (apuv2)
so far. And several planned features (eg. consistency checks) yet
missing.

Of course, patches are welcomed :)
